### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a fourth-year undergraduate student finishing up a Bachelor of Science with Joint Honours in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a minor in biochemistry. Iâ€™m passionate about applications of AI and machine learning to healthcare and itâ€™s ethical implications, and am hoping to do graduate studies in the field.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to be a fellow at the AI4Good lab in 2022 and attended the Bumblekite machine learning summer school in healthcare and the biosciences in July 2023. Currently, Last summer, I was a research student at The Simpson Lab at Queenâ€™s University working on AI ethics in healthcare. Previously, Iâ€™ve worked for Dr. Matthew Betti on mathematical epidemiology at Mount Allison University, where I also work as a teaching assistant in the math and computer science department.
